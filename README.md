## ✨ The Problem We Solve

Indian students aspiring to study abroad face a **fragmented journey** – jumping between websites for university discovery, applications, visa rules, financial planning, and education loans. This leads to information overload, delayed decisions, and missed opportunities.

**80% of students feel overwhelmed. 65% delay decisions due to financial uncertainty. 70% wish for a single AI mentor.**
